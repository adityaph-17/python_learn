# PIP FREEZE COMMAND
# ‘pip freeze’ returns all the package installed in a given python environment along with
# the versions.

# pip freeze > requirements .txt

# The above command creates a file named ‘requirements.txt’ in the same directory
# containing the output of ‘pip freeze’

# We can distribute this file to other users, and they can recreate the same environment
# using:
# pip install –r requirements.txt
